            <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Angelica Daniel, Hi I'm Angelica daniel, 19 years old currently living in sta. Cruz magsaysay misamis oriental, and I only lived with my father since my mom and dad broke up 17 years ago, ik it's sad but I need to face the reality and focus on my future as long as I have my father who loved me very much and take care of me I'll take the opportunity to focus on my studies. And we're happy now just living the two of us. And I'm the younger child in my family but my brother and sister now have their own family. And I am now a first year college and I've always been fascinated by how technology works.  That's why I'm thrilled to be a IT student at gingoog city colleges.  I'm enjoying learning about programming and learn new things about computer  and etc. I'm excited to explore this field further and develop my skills in technology .</p>
